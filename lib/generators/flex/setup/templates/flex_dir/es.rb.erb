# inspect the methods loaded in this module and their usage
# in the rails console by just typing:
# >> puts <%= @class_name %>.flex.doc
# you can eventually restrict the doc to a single method by pasing its name:
# >> puts <%= @class_name %>.flex.doc :search

module <%= @class_name %>

  extend self

  # if you don't use flex scopes and you stick with flex templates, you can comment the next line
  include Flex::Scopes

  # enables the templating
  include Flex::Templates
  # loads the <%= "#{@class_name.underscore}.yml" %> file
  flex.load_search_source

  # you may need to add more method here, usually custom scopes
  # or wrapper methods that use one of the autogenerated methods from the loaded templates

end
